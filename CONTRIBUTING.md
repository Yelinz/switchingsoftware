## Licensing

Everything you contribute will be published unter CC-BY-SA 4.0. Differently licensed content must be marked as such and might be removed.

## Workflow

With all this being said, here is a quick overview on how to contribute text/coding to this project

- **Fork:** Login with your codeberg account and [fork this project][fork].
- **Branch:** Create a branch for the topic you want to takle.
  - Please give it a meaningful name, p.e. `yourname/fix-issue-1234`.
  - Hint: Creating a new branch via web interface can be done by typing its name into the branch dropdown on the main page
- **Edit:** Make changes to your branch.
  - For minor changes, you can do this directly in the browser on Codeberg.
  - For larger changes, you should pull the project onto your computer and edit it locally. This way, you can also [live-preview changes][hugo-live] by [installing hugo][hugo-install].
  - Hint: Start your commit messages with an imperative verb to keep them short and meaningful, p.e. `Fix typo on About page`
- **Propose:** Create a pull request against the "develop" branch of this repository.
  - Please give it a meaningful title, p.e. `Fix typos and dead links on About page`.
  - The description should contain the related issue (p.e. `Fixes #1234`)
  - If there is no issue, please provide a short explanation on the purpose of your request.

Afterwards, every [maintainer][swiso-maintainer] is invited to review your proposal. As this project is maintained during spare time, this might take a while. Please be patient.

If everything's fine, it gets merged into the "develop" branch. The changes can be previewed at https://develop.switching.software then. Once a few changes have been collected, they get merged into "primary" by [an admin][swiso-admin] and thereby auto-deployed to the main website.
