If you want to support this site, here are some things you can do.


### Spread the word

Recommend this website and [its alternatives][bye-swiso] to friends that might be interested.


### Proofread our site

This site is quite large and we are only a few persons working on it in our spare time. So, whenever you see outdated information, non-working links, typos or similar things, please let us know via our [contact form][contact], [Mastodon account][mastodon] or [issue tracker][issues].


### Support the listed projects

Our site is only as good as the alternatives it has to offer. If you think a project is on the right track, give them your support. This doesn't have to be financially. Often a helping hand on documentation, translations, discussions, artwork etc. is even more helpful. Something as simple as a motivating personal e-mail to the author may help a lot.
