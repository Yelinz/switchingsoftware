### Origin of this site

Switching.software is a fork of a former website known as ['switching.social'][switching.social]. It was created and maintained by an anonymous person and gained popularity in 2018 and 2019 - especially on the [Fediverse][fediverse].

In September 2019, the author took down all social media channels and the website itself. There hasn't been any statement by them ever since. No matter the reasons, [we want to thank them a lot][thanks] for what they have achieved with this project - and wish them well.

To keep the project alive, the site was restored from different sources - resulting in [a bunch of HTML pages][swiso-archive]. Since then, a loose team of enthusiasts has started a fork based on the original articles. We want to maintain and improve the project. Progress on this endeavor can be seen in [our repository][swiso-repo].
