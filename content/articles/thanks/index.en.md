discussing of content,  
drafting of texts and  
writing of code.

**Be it indirectly**  
via asking questions,  
searching for answers,  
sharing the results and  
spreading the word.

**Be it essentially**  
by contributing to any  
free / libre / open projects

**This is yours.**  
A tribute to a space of  
hope, trust, and freedom  
with all its imperfections  
and inspirations.

**We say thanks**  
to you, and especially  
to the anonymous author  
who made this small website  
a part of the digital journey  
we keep on enjoying  
**Together.**
