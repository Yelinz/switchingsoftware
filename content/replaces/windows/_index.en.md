If you’re using a PC, it’s probably running Microsoft Windows. Microsoft has come under sustained criticism for not respecting their users’ privacy. Just to give one example, by default [Windows records everything you type and sends this to Microsoft][keylogger], and Windows carries on sending your data to Microsoft [even when you tell it not to][chatterbox].

The most famous alternative is Apple’s Mac line of computers. While being good at privacy, they use closed source software. So we can’t be sure of what they are doing. [Purism][purism] is far more transparent on this behalf, but both are quite expensive.

Thankfully, there are privacy-conscious easy-to-use alternatives which are free and can be installed on your existing PC. If you want a ready-to-use computer, head over to our [hardware recommendations][hardware].
