Many websites nowadays use Google’s reCAPTCHA service to try to verify that visitors are real people. While this is useful for preventing misuse of websites by bots, it also helps Google violate people’s privacy.

Also, because of their deliberately inaccessible nature, reCAPTCHA and other captchas cause serious accessibility problems for those with poor eyesight or hearing. The visual challenge is invisible to people using non-visual web browsers (such as screen readers), and the audio challenge can be very hard to make out.

If you run a website and value your site’s privacy and accessibility, you might want to consider alternatives to reCAPTCHA.
