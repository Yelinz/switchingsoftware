Microsoft Office has some serious problems with privacy, as this [official report for the Dutch government][report] explains:

> “Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Covertly, without informing people, … Microsoft does not offer any choice with regard to the amount of data, or possibility to switch off the collection, or ability to see what data are collected…”

We would recommend you drop Microsoft Office for your own sake, and for the sake of people you deal with (friends, customers, co-workers). There are better alternatives that offer the same features without violating people's privacy.
