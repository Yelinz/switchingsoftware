The video game platform Steam is really useful and wildly popular, apparently accounting for over 50% of downloaded PC game sales.

However, Steam’s game sales are built around a [Digital Rights Management][drm] (DRM) app that you have to install on your computer before you can buy and use games. If you remove Steam’s app, almost all games bought from Steam will instantly stop working too. (There are a few exceptions to this, here’s an [unofficial list of DRM-free Steam games][drm-free-steam] which will not stop working.)

If Steam tells their users to do something, the users have to either accept it or lose their games collection. The more people buy games on Steam, the more power Steam has over its customers, because the games are locked to Steam’s app. Making the situation even worse, many publishers don’t bother publishing games elsewhere, so fans of those games are forced to use steam. It’s a vicious circle.

There’s already been [controversy about publishers including spyware in some Steam games][steam-spyware], and while the publishers backed down in this case, there’s nothing to stop this happening again. Even if you trust Steam’s current management, a private [company’s ownership can change very quickly][valve] and [unexpectedly][minecraft]. And there are [reasons not to trust Steam’s current management][steam-doubt].

It’s a troubling situation, so here are some better alternatives:
