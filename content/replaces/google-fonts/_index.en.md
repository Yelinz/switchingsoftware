Google Fonts is a convenient way to add fonts to your website, but it also helps Google to track your visitors and violate their privacy. That’s why Google provides the service, because they are a profit-making company whose business model depends entirely on tracking people online.

If you value your visitors’ privacy, switch to a privacy-friendly alternative.
