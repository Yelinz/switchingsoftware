Amazon is very convenient to use, but the convenience comes at a price. While the [list of misconducts][amazon-criticism] is long, the main burden redounds upon the [workers in their warehouses][workers] and the communities that [Amazon deprives of taxes][taxes].

Furthermore, their Kindle eBooks have a severe restriction: [Digital Rights Management][drm] (DRM). This enables Amazon to [delete specific books][orwell] or [wipe a Kindle reader completely][wipe] without justification. In effect, you never really own a Kindle book.

Luckily there are lots of more ethical alternatives, online and offline. For audiobooks, you can also have a look at [these alternatives for Amazon's Audible][audible].
