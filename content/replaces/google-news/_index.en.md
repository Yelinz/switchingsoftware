Google News is convenient because it combines so many different news sources into one page, but the downside is that Google gets to choose what news you see. If they don’t want to show you something, you’ll never see it. Using Google News also allows Google to permanently record your newsreading habits.

There are easy-to-use alternatives that respect privacy and let you choose which news sources to follow.
