The petition site change.org is extremely popular, but many are surprised to learn it is a for-profit corporation. It isnâ€™t a charity, it exists to make money and has investors who expect a return.

Giving a profit-making corporation your real name as well as your opinions on a wide range of topics is not a wise idea in the long term. That sort of data is very valuable to advertisers, and sooner or later a company may be tempted to sell it to them.
