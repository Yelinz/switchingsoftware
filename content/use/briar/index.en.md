**Briar** is an encrypted instant messenger that connects to contacts via the Tor network. If internet isn't available, you can also connect directly via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

Briar works without any central servers. It is especially suitable for journalists and activists who are operating in environments where communications are difficult.
