Many classic books are old enough to be in the public domain, so they are legal to download and distribute free of charge.

There are several major sites which distribute free public domain eBooks. All of these downloads are unrestricted and without [DRM][drm]. If you need help with formats etc., have a look at [The Epubizer][epubizer].
