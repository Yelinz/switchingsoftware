Fairphone tries to get as much of its raw materials as possible from sources
with decent working conditions and fair wages. The latest model, the
Fairphone 3, also uses a modular design so that if one part breaks you can
easily replace it yourself without having to buy a new phone.

The phone’s software is Android, and it will work just like any other Android
phone. The price may seem a bit high, but the manufacturers are transparent
about where the money goes, and this is how much a phone costs to make when you
pay people fairly all the way down the supply chain.
