**IPFS** is a decentralized network for storing and sharing data online. Instead of custom URLs, files are automatically addressed based on their content and served by their users.

Currently, most websites depend on central servers. Therefore, content tends to be slow-loading, proprietary and short-lived. IPFS _"seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files"_ to ease discovering, spreading and archiving of content.
