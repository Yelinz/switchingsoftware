**Snikket** is an open-source easy-to-use decentralized messaging app. It
supports encrypted chats, voice and video calls and group messaging. It does
not require a phone number, and allows you to add multiple devices on the same
account.

Once you create your private Snikket instance (either hosted or
[self-hosted](/self-hosting/)), you can invite your family and friends to join
you by sharing a simple link. Snikket is part of an open network based on the
standard messaging protocol [XMPP](/use/xmpp/), so you can also communicate
with people on other Snikket instances and compatible messaging services.
