**Write Freely** is a blogging service like Medium where the focus is on the text itself, with a clean uncluttered aesthetic.

The site is [open source][floss] and extremely privacy-friendly, collecting the absolute minimum amount of information needed for it to work.

Write Freely has just started [federating][fediverse] using the ActivityPub standard, so you can follow Write Freely blogs through e.g. Mastodon account.
