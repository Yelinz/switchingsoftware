**Write Freely** is a blogging service like Medium where the focus is on the text itself, with a clean uncluttered aesthetic.

The site is open source and extremely privacy-friendly, collecting the absolute minimum amount of information needed for it to work.

Write Freely has just started federating using the ActivityPub standard, so you can follow Write Freely blogs through e.g. Mastodon account.
