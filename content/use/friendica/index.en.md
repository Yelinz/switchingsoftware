**Friendica** is a Facebook-style social network with similar features including events and photo albums. Like Mastodon, Friendica is made up of many smaller sites linked together through [federation][fediverse]. The smaller sites that make up the Friendica network are called “nodes”.

Friendica is also connected to [Mastodon][mastodon], Diaspora, [PixelFed][pixelfed], [PeerTube][peertube] and many other alternative social networks, so you can make friends with people on all those networks too.
