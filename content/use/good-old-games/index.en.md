**GOG** is a Steam-like video games platform without any Digital Rights Management: games you buy are yours forever, no one can take them away from you.

GOG has become well-known for selling classic older games that have been fixed to work on modern computers, but they also sell some more modern titles too.

There’s a games management app called GOG Galaxy, but it’s totally optional. GOG games can be bought and used without GOG Galaxy.

There’s also a service called [GOG Connect][gog-connect] which lets you transfer certain games you already bought on Steam onto GOG free of charge.
