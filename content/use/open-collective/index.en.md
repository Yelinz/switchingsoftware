**Open Collective** is a more advanced platform specially designed for crowdfunded projects and organisations that want to be as transparent as possible about how donations are spent.

It lets projects accept both one-time and recurring donations/sponsorships, but also lets them give detailed open accounts of expenditure, and helps members of the project file or discuss expenses.
