**Matomo** analytics lets sites keep their visitor data private without sharing it with anyone else, and is compliant with GDPR regulations. It also respects the web browser No Follow standard (which lets users opt out of web tracking by selecting “No Follow” in their browser options).

Matomo’s software is free and [open source][floss], so anyone can install and use it on their own servers completely free of charge. There are also paid options for those who don’t want to host analytics software themselves.
