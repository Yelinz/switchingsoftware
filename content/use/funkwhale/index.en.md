**Funkwhale** is a [libre][floss] [federated][fediverse] music platform, similar to Grooveshark or SoundCloud. It lets you easily discover and share music online through a music-oriented social network. 

It’s still being developed, but you can try it out at the demo link below, or join one of the “whales” listed on the project website.
