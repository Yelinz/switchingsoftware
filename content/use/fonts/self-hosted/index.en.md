You don’t need to use an external service at all. You can host your site’s fonts yourself and refer to them in the page’s code.

There are many free open fonts which you can legally download, host and use on your own site without payment.

Most font download sites have a mixture of non-free and free fonts, so make sure you check each font’s licence before using it on your site. The ones you want are labelled “GPL”, “OFL” or “Public Domain”.

Also, you don’t actually have to use Google Fonts to use its fonts, because they are under free licences anyway. There’s an [unofficial site which makes it as easy as possible to download these fonts][gfont-download] and self-host them instead.
