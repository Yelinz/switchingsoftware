**CryptPad** is a collection of [open source][floss] and privacy-friendly collaboration tools. They let you easily create documents, presentations, sheets, polls and more in your browser. Based on the “zero knowledge” concept, no one except you (and whoever you give your access keys to) can access your data.

The service is free up to a certain storage limit, with paid accounts for additional storage. You can even use the free service without registering if you want to. It’s worth registering though, as you can keep your documents permanently online this way.
