**Jami** (formerly "Ring") is a [libre][floss] easy-to-use alternative to Skype, with voice call, video call and messaging. 

It is open source and designed to respect its usersâ€™ privacy, with calls going directly from one user to another without using servers. It gives all its members a unique code, which they can share with others, so that they can add each other on the service.
