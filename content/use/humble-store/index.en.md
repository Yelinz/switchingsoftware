The charity initiative **Humble Bundle** also has an online store that sells both [DRM][drm] and DRM-free games (the link below goes to their DRM-free section).

The storeâ€™s games are often sold in co-operation with other platforms (including Steam and GOG), but by buying them through Humble a portion of the sales go to charity.
