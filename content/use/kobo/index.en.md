**Kobo** is a global eBook seller and perhaps the most comprehensive alternative to Kindle. Its bookshop Kobo.com sells both [DRM][drm] and DRM-free eBooks. 

The site doesn’t include any official way to separate the DRM from DRM-free titles, but you can search for DRM-free eBooks through [our unofficial Kobo search page][kobo-search].

Kobo also make quite nice eReaders which can read almost all eBook formats (including DRM-free ones), and let you borrow eBooks from public libraries. You don’t have to use these though, as DRM-free eBooks can be read on any manufacturer’s device.
