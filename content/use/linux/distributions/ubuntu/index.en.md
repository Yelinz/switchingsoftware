**Ubuntu** is the most well-known Linux operating system variant. It became popular by its universal usability, as it doesn't require technical knowledge to use it. 

You can try out Ubuntu before installing it. Furthermore, aside from replacing your current operating system, you can install Ubuntu next to it (called a "dual boot" system). Both can be done with most Linux distributions.
