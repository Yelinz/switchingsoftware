**Scuttlebutt** is a social network with no servers. All your data is stored on your own computer or phone, and you can use it offline. 

Thereâ€™s a mobile app for ScuttleButt called Manyverse and a desktop app called Patchwork. Some parts of it are still in development, so it can be tricky to use.
